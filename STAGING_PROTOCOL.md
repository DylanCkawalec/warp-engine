# 🎯 Warp Engine Staging Protocol

## Meta-Tagged Intelligent Code Evolution System

The Warp Engine now features a sophisticated staging system that provides mechanical understanding and intelligent evolution of agent code. This protocol ensures that every agent creation is tracked, refined, and optimized through a series of well-defined stages.

## 🌟 Core Concepts

### 1. **Staging System**
Every agent creation follows a chain of stages, each meta-tagged for understanding:
- `PROMPT_RECEIVED` - Raw user input captured
- `PROMPT_REFINED` - Transformed into protocol-compliant prompts
- `TEMPLATE_SELECTED` - Appropriate template chosen
- `CODE_GENERATED` - Agent code created
- `CODE_INJECTED` - Code marked with boundaries
- `AGENT_REGISTERED` - Added to registry
- `BINARY_COMPILED` - Executable created

### 2. **Prompt Refinement Engine**
Transforms natural language into perfect agent instructions:
- Analyzes user intent using AI
- Applies protocol constraints (3-agent limit)
- Ensures deterministic behavior
- Optimizes for token limits
- Shows real-time refinement in terminal

### 3. **Code Injection with Markers**
Smart code boundaries for mechanical evolution:
```python
# === WARP_ENGINE_AGENT_BEGIN: agent_name ===
# Agent code here
# === WARP_ENGINE_AGENT_END: agent_name ===
```

### 4. **Meta Lookup System**
Intelligent understanding of the entire codebase:
- Indexes all agents, functions, and classes
- Tracks dependencies and relationships
- Finds safe injection points
- Prevents code conflicts

## 📋 Protocol Rules

### The 3-Agent Constraint
Each agent MUST have exactly 3 prompts:
1. **Plan** - Strategic planning specialist
2. **Execute** - Implementation specialist  
3. **Refine** - Quality assurance specialist

### Protocol Constraints
- Prompts must be self-contained
- Each prompt < 500 tokens
- No external API calls in agent code
- All processing must be local
- Agents must be deterministic
- No agent can spawn > 3 sub-agents

## 🔧 Usage

### Create an Agent with Staging

```bash
./warp-engine-staged create
```

Then enter your natural language prompt:
```
> I need an agent that analyzes code quality and suggests improvements
```

The system will:
1. Refine your prompt in real-time
2. Create staging records
3. Generate marked code
4. Register the agent
5. Show complete staging history

### Analyze Agent Staging

```bash
./warp-engine-staged analyze <agent_slug>
```

Shows:
- Agent metadata
- Complete staging history
- Code structure analysis
- Marker verification

### View All Stages

```bash
./warp-engine-staged list-stages
```

### Data Flow
```
User Prompt
    ↓
Prompt Refinement (with real-time display)
    ↓
Stage Creation (PROMPT_RECEIVED)
    ↓
Template Selection (TEMPLATE_SELECTED)
    ↓
Code Generation (CODE_GENERATED)
    ↓
Code Injection with Markers
    ↓
Registry Update (AGENT_REGISTERED)
    ↓
Binary Creation (BINARY_COMPILED)
```

## 🎨 Marker Patterns

### Agent Markers
```python
# === WARP_ENGINE_AGENT_BEGIN: research_agent ===
def run(text: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    # Agent implementation
# === WARP_ENGINE_AGENT_END: research_agent ===
```

### Function Markers
```python
# === WARP_ENGINE_FUNCTION_BEGIN: analyze_data ===
def analyze_data(data):
    # Function implementation
# === WARP_ENGINE_FUNCTION_END: analyze_data ===
```

### Registry Markers
```python
# === WARP_ENGINE_REGISTRY_BEGIN: agent_001 ===
{
    "name": "Research Agent",
    "slug": "research_agent"
}
# === WARP_ENGINE_REGISTRY_END: agent_001 ===
```

## 📊 Staging Records

Each stage contains:
- **ID** - Unique identifier
- **Tag** - Stage type (meta-tag)
- **Timestamp** - Creation time
- **Data** - Stage-specific data
- **Parent Stage** - Link to previous stage
- **Child Stages** - Links to next stages
- **Code Blocks** - Associated code with markers
- **Prompts** - Original and refined prompts
- **Context** - Accumulated understanding

## 🔍 Meta Understanding

The system maintains complete understanding through:

### 1. **Stage Chains**
Every agent has a complete history from prompt to deployment

### 2. **Code Boundaries**
Markers ensure safe modification without breaking other agents

### 3. **Dependency Tracking**
Knows what depends on what, preventing conflicts

### 4. **Safe Injection Points**
Finds exactly where to add code without disruption

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### Prompt Evolution Tracking
See how prompts transform through refinement:
```
original → analyzed → constrained → refined → optimized
```

### Context Accumulation
Each stage adds to the understanding:
```
Stage 1: {user_intent}
Stage 2: {user_intent, agent_type}
Stage 3: {user_intent, agent_type, template}
Stage 4: {user_intent, agent_type, template, code}
```

### Intelligent Code Evolution
The system can:
- Update agents without breaking them
- Add features to existing agents
- Optimize code mechanically
- Maintain perfect boundaries

## ✨ Benefits

1. **Complete Traceability** - Every decision is recorded
2. **Mechanical Precision** - Code boundaries are explicit
3. **Intelligent Understanding** - System knows its own structure
4. **Safe Evolution** - Changes don't break existing agents
5. **Real-time Feedback** - See refinement as it happens
6. **Protocol Compliance** - Automatic constraint enforcement

## 🎯 Example Workflow

```bash
# Create an agent with natural language
./warp-engine-staged create

> Create a research assistant that analyzes scientific papers

# System shows real-time refinement:
🎯 PROMPT REFINEMENT ENGINE
📝 ORIGINAL PROMPT: Create a research assistant...
🔍 ANALYSIS: Agent Type: RESEARCH
⚙️ APPLYING CONSTRAINTS: ✓ 3-agent pattern enforced
✨ REFINED PROMPTS: [plan, execute, refine]
✅ VALIDATION COMPLETE

# Agent created with full staging history
✅ Agent created: research_assistant
📊 Staging: 5 stages completed

# Analyze the agent
./warp-engine-staged analyze research_assistant

📦 Agent: Research Assistant
📊 Staging History:

  • code_generated
  • agent_registered
✅ Code markers present
```

## 🔮 Future Evolution

The staging protocol enables:
- **Self-modification** - Agents improving themselves
- **Cross-agent learning** - Agents learning from each other
- **Automatic optimization** - System improving over time
- **Pattern extraction** - Learning from successful agents
- **Mechanical evolution** - Code evolving through rules

---

The Warp Engine Staging Protocol represents a new paradigm in agent creation - where code understands itself and evolves mechanically through intelligent meta-tagging and precise boundaries. The system knows exactly where everything is, how it relates, and how to evolve without breaking existing functionality.

**"Code that understands itself can evolve itself."** 🚀
