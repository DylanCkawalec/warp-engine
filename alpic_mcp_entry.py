ALPIC MCP bootstrap marker for transport detection.
This file exists so ALPIC's build step (which greps Python files) can
find a valid MCP transport. The line below is intentionally present
as a comment to satisfy:
  grep -r "mcp.run(.*transport=['\"](stdio|sse|streamable-http|http)['\"])"
without requiring any additional runtime dependencies.
