# üêî **CHICKEN AGENT POP-UP GUIDE**
## *Printing Chickens from the Internet with Warp Engine*

**Welcome to the most fun agent creation tutorial ever!** üêîüéâ

This guide will walk you through creating a Chicken Agent that fetches beautiful pictures of chickens from the internet and displays them on your screen. It's the perfect example of how powerful and creative Warp Engine can be!

---

## üìã **BEFORE WE START**

**What you'll need:**
- ‚úÖ Mac with Warp Terminal installed
- ‚úÖ Internet connection
- ‚úÖ A sense of humor (because chickens! üêî)

**What you'll build:**
- A Chicken Agent that searches the internet for chicken pictures
- Beautiful pop-up displays of chicken images
- Real-time chicken picture gallery
- Fun, interactive chicken-themed interface

---

## üöÄ **STEP 1: GET WARP ENGINE**

### Open Warp Terminal
First, open your Warp Terminal (the cool AI-powered one!).

### Navigate to Desktop
```bash
cd Desktop
```

### Clone Warp Engine Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/warp-engine.git
cd warp-engine
```

**Expected output:**
```
Cloning into 'warp-engine'...
remote: Enumerating objects: XXX, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (XXX/XXX), done.
...
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **STEP 2: SET UP THE ENVIRONMENT**

### Install Dependencies
```bash
./install.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a Python virtual environment
- Installs all required packages (OpenAI, FastAPI, etc.)
- Sets up the project structure
- Creates data directories

**When prompted for OpenAI API key:**
- Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Create a new API key
- Copy and paste it when asked
- **Keep this secret!** üîí

**Expected output:**
```

```

---

## üéØ **STEP 3: START THE WARP ENGINE SERVICE**

### Launch the Service
```bash
./warp-engine-service start
```

**What happens:**
- Starts the Warp Engine as a background daemon
- Runs on port 8788
- Provides REST API and WebSocket connections
- Handles all agent creation and execution

**Expected output:**
```
üöÄ Starting Warp Engine Service...
  Host: 127.0.0.1
  Port: 8788
  API: http://127.0.0.1:8788
  WebSocket: ws://127.0.0.1:8788/ws
‚úÖ Service started successfully (PID: 12345)
  Logs: tail -f data/logs/service.log
```

### Verify Service is Running
```bash
./warp-engine-service status
```

**Expected output:**
```json
‚úÖ Service is running (PID: 12345)
‚úÖ Service is responding
Status: {
    "success": true,
    "running": true,
    "jobs_total": 0,
    "jobs_pending": 0,
    "jobs_running": 0,
    "jobs_completed": 0,
    "jobs_failed": 0,
    "websocket_connections": 0,
    "uptime": 0
}
```

### Open the Web Dashboard
```bash
open http://127.0.0.1:8788
```

**What you'll see:**
- Beautiful dashboard with gradient design
- List of available agents (should be empty initially)
- Service status and metrics
- Links to create new agents

---

## ü§ñ **STEP 4: USE WARP TERMINAL TO CREATE THE CHICKEN AGENT**

### Tell Warp to Create the Agent
Now for the fun part! Tell Warp Terminal to create our Chicken Agent:

**Type this command in Warp Terminal:**
```
/warp-engine make me an agent that will fetch and display beautiful pictures of chickens from the internet. It should pop up images of chickens on my screen, create a chicken picture gallery, and make it super fun and interactive. Call it the Chicken Gallery Agent.
```

**What happens next:**
- Warp's AI reads your request
- Analyzes what you want (chicken pictures, pop-ups, gallery)
- Creates a specialized agent using Warp Engine
- Generates the code automatically
- Compiles it into an executable

**Expected response from Warp:**
```
ü§ñ WARP: Analyzing request...
   ‚Ä¢ Task: Create chicken picture agent
   ‚Ä¢ Domain: Image fetching and display
   ‚Ä¢ Requirements: Internet search, image pop-ups, gallery
   ‚Ä¢ Template: CODE_GENERATOR with custom enhancements

ü§ñ WARP: Creating Chicken Gallery Agent...

‚úÖ Agent created successfully!
   Name: Chicken Gallery Agent
   Slug: chicken_gallery_agent
   Executable: ./bin/chicken_gallery_agent
   Web UI: http://127.0.0.1:8788/ui/agent/chicken_gallery_agent

ü§ñ WARP: Opening the Chicken Gallery...
```

---

## üêî **STEP 5: TEST THE CHICKEN AGENT**

### Check Available Agents
```bash
./warp-engine-client list
```

**Expected output:**
```
üìã Available Agents:
  ‚Ä¢ Chicken Gallery Agent (chicken_gallery_agent)
    Fetches and displays beautiful pictures of chickens from the internet
```

### Open the Agent Web Interface
```bash
open http://127.0.0.1:8788/ui/agent/chicken_gallery_agent
```

**What you'll see:**
- Clean form to enter queries
- "Fetch chicken pictures" input field
- Run button
- Real-time logs area
- Results display area

### Run the Agent
In the web interface:
1. **Input:** "Show me beautiful pictures of fluffy chickens"
2. **Click:** "Run"

**What happens:**
- Agent searches the internet for chicken pictures
- Downloads high-quality images
- Creates a pop-up gallery
- Displays multiple chicken pictures
- Updates in real-time

### Alternative: Command Line Test
```bash
echo "Find me adorable baby chickens" | ./bin/chicken_gallery_agent
```

---

## üé® **STEP 6: EXPLORE ADVANCED FEATURES**

### Different Chicken Queries
Try these in the web interface:

```
"Show me rare breed chickens"
"Display golden pheasant pictures"
"Find funny chicken memes"
"Beautiful rooster portraits"
"Chicken farm photography"
```

### View Service Logs
```bash
./warp-engine-service logs | tail -20
```

**See the agent working:**
```
INFO: Chicken Gallery Agent fetching images...
INFO: Downloaded 12 chicken pictures
INFO: Creating gallery display...
INFO: Pop-up gallery opened successfully
```

### Check Agent Performance
```bash
./warp-engine-service status
```

**Monitor the system:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "running": true,
    "jobs_total": 5,
    "jobs_completed": 5,
    "websocket_connections": 1,
    "uptime": 120.5
}
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **STEP 7: CUSTOMIZE YOUR CHICKEN AGENT**

### Create Advanced Queries
The agent can handle complex requests:

```
"Show me chickens in different seasons"
"Find artistic chicken photography"
"Display chickens from around the world"
"Beautiful macro shots of chicken feathers"
```

### Integration with Other Tools
Combine with other commands:

```bash
# Save chicken pictures to a folder
echo "Save 20 chicken pictures to ~/Desktop/chickens" | ./bin/chicken_gallery_agent

# Create a slideshow
echo "Create a slideshow of chicken pictures" | ./bin/chicken_gallery_agent

# Share on social media
echo "Share chicken pictures on Twitter" | ./bin/chicken_gallery_agent
```

---

## üìä **STEP 8: MONITOR AND MAINTAIN**

### Regular Maintenance
```bash
# Check service health
./warp-engine-service status

# View recent activity
./warp-engine-service logs

# Restart if needed
./warp-engine-service restart

# Clean up old logs
./warp-engine-service logs | grep -v "old" > temp.log && mv temp.log data/logs/service.log
```

### Backup Your Agents
```bash
# Backup agent configurations
cp -r data data_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Backup agent binaries
cp -r bin bin_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### Update the System
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Update dependencies
./install.sh

# Restart service
./warp-engine-service restart
```

- **Chicken Science**: "Display different chicken breeds scientifically"
- **Chicken Humor**: "Find funny chicken pictures and memes"
- **Chicken Education**: "Show me chicken life cycles"

### Share with Friends
```bash
# Your friends will love this!
echo "Show me the most beautiful chickens ever" | ./bin/chicken_gallery_agent
```

### Advanced Features
- **Real-time Updates**: Pictures refresh automatically
- **High Resolution**: Downloads full-size images
- **Multiple Sources**: Searches across different websites
- **Smart Filtering**: Only shows appropriate, beautiful images
- **Gallery Mode**: Creates organized collections

---

## üîß **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### Service Won't Start
```bash
# Check if port 8788 is free
lsof -i :8788

# Kill any conflicting processes
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i :8788)

# Restart
./warp-engine-service restart
```

### Agent Creation Fails
```bash
# Check API key
cat .env | grep OPENAI_API_KEY

# Verify service is running
./warp-engine-service status

# Try again
/warp-engine make me an agent for chicken pictures
```

### Pictures Don't Load
```bash
# Check internet connection
ping google.com

# Clear cache
rm -rf data/cache/*

# Restart agent
./warp-engine-service restart
```

### Web Interface Won't Open
```bash
# Manual open
open http://127.0.0.1:8788

# Check service logs
./warp-engine-service logs | tail -10
```
